# racket-renderer

A simple 3D renderer made in the functional programming language [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/). Done as a personal project in computer graphics

Utilizes ray tracing, supersampling anti-aliasing, and Phong illumination. The math for the project was primarily taken from [this tutorial](https://avikdas.com/build-your-own-raytracer/) by Avik Das.
